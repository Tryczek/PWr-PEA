This repository encompasses solutions to problems from the "Efficient Algorithm Design" course led by Tomasz Kapłon at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. The focus of the repository revolves around solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using various algorithms. The implemented algorithms include Tabu Search, Held-Karp, Brute Force, and Ant Colony Optimization. The code is written in C++.

Tabu Search:
Tabu Search is a local search algorithm that explores the solution space iteratively, aiming to find an optimal solution. It utilizes a memory structure to avoid revisiting previously explored solutions, preventing cycling.

Held-Karp:
Held-Karp is a dynamic programming algorithm specifically designed for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem. It optimally computes the shortest tour through all cities by considering subproblems and building up the solution.

Brute Force:
Brute Force is a straightforward approach that exhaustively explores all possible solutions to find the optimal one. While not efficient for large problem instances, it guarantees an optimal solution.

Ant Colony Optimization:
Ant Colony Optimization is inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It uses artificial ants to traverse the solution space, laying pheromones on paths. The probability of choosing a path is influenced by the amount of pheromone, leading to emergent optimal paths.

These algorithms showcase different paradigms for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem, each with its strengths and weaknesses. The C++ code in this repository provides practical implementations of these algorithms, serving as a valuable resource for understanding and experimenting with efficient algorithm design concepts at Wrocław University of Science and Technology.
